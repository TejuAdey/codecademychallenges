Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is:
Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses
During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:

50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.

SELECT number_of_pairs,COUNT(product_id)
FROM home_try_on
LEFT JOIN purchase
ON home_try_on.user_id = purchase.user_id
GROUP BY number_of_pairs;
